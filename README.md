# RobotMotorsControl

## Project Description
RobotMotorsControl is a Python-based project aimed at providing a basic framework for controlling motor movements in robotic projects. The initial steps taken in this project lay the foundation for more complex functionalities.

## Progress Overview

1. **Initial Setup**: Created `README.md` and a draft Python script (`motors_control.py`) directly on GitHub.
2. **Credential Caching**: Implemented a mechanism to cache credentials for 15 minutes to streamline the development process.
3. **Script Implementation**: Developed and pushed the initial version of the `motors_control.py` script, which includes basic motor control functionalities.
4. **Adding motor features**: Debeloped more enhanced speed control script in `motors_control.py`.
